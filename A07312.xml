         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore partly preſuming, and partly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that it might do ſome good, vnto ſuch as labour,
<pb facs="tcp:21025:3"/>
either to get goods with a good conſcience, or to vſe their goods already gotten in a good and godly manner, I was ſomuch the more willing to ſet it out to publicke veiw. And becauſe it was mine hap to proſecute my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to run my Philoſophicall courſe in the Noble Citty of <hi>EDINBVRGE,</hi> whereby my ſmall capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city hath herein been furthered; and my fortune to write and finiſh this preſent Arte in this famous Citty of <hi>LONDON,</hi> where now I liue: therefore I thought it my duty to dedicate the ſame vnto the foreſaid two moſt Honourable Citties of this Ile, and that for a testimony of mine obſeruancy, and gratefull affection towards them both; Being ſomuch the more moued to implore and imploy their honourable patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage therein, as for becauſe that the ſubiect thereof doth eſpecially concerne Citties and Citizens, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all ſuch in Citty or country as labour to be rich in the right way. In it truely is contained whatſoeuer thing the Sacred Scripture diſperſedly doth afford concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pouerty and riches, and the vertues and vices which are incident or conuerſant about the ſame. Out of the which holy Booke, I haue collected the whole rules reaſons, probations, and exemplifications of this Arte, and therfore I haue not amplyfied nor enlarged my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as I might haue done with the forraine stuffe of humane teſtimonies, and that for theſe three reaſons. Firſt becauſe that the holy Scripture beeing diligently ſearched is no leſſe-ſufficient to ſhew a man the right way of <hi>Enriching,</hi> then it is of <hi>Beleeuing;</hi> &amp; that the reaſons and teſtimonies thereof are of vncontroullable authority. Secondly becauſe I did foreſee how that this Arte by ſuch enlarging would ariſe to ſuch a volume,
<pb facs="tcp:21025:3"/>
that it ſhould bee both hardly reade ouer of rich men, who haue too little time to peruſe large bookes, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compaſſed or got of poore men, who haue too little money to buy big bookes. And lastly, becauſe it is my purpoſe, God willing, to diſcourſe both Theologically, and Philoſophically, in the Arte of <hi>Flying,</hi> how that no leſle then theſe ten Schoolemaisters, <hi>1.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21025:13"/>
then to vſe or rather abuſe ſo irreuerently, as the moſt part now adaies doe, the adorable name of God, to ſweare almoſt at euery word by the ſame, and by the bleſſed name of Ieſus, by his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by his wounds, and by his blood?

But theſe lewde mouthed men will neither reuerence him with the bowing of the knee, nor honour him with the confeſſion and ſanctification of the tongue. Their knees will not honour the Sonne, and their tongues wil needs diſhonour both the Father and the Sonne. Well, let them be rich who will, ſurely ſuch as bee proud in Gods ſight, and will neither praiſe him nor pray vnto him, and ſuch as be prophaners of his holy name, and of his holy day, and will not ſanctifie both, they ſhall neuer be rich in God. They may well gather goods, but they ſhall not proue goods to them, they ſhall not turne to their good, neither ſhall they reape any good at Gods hand by them, neither ſhall they remaine to them and theirs. For only the feare of God (which mother-vertue theſe men want) is the fountaine of good goods, and of durable riches.</p>
               <p>Now the feare of God hath two branches, the one is, we muſt feare to offend him, becauſe he is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21025:14"/>
our Father, whom we muſt loue in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: the other is, when we haue offended him, we muſt feare his furie and puniſhments, becauſe he is our Lord. Our feare muſt not be ſeruile or ſlauiſh, ſuch as is the bond-mans feare of his maſter, which is onely and meerely becauſe of puniſhment: but our feare muſt bee filiall and ſonly, ſuch as is the childrens feare of their father,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 2.11.</note> as being loth to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend one whom we loue: we muſt ſerue the Lord in feare and trembling: we muſt feare to offend, before we offend; and when as through humane frailtie we fall into any offence, wee muſt tremble for feare of his rods: like faultie and guiltie chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren we muſt ſhake and quake before the face of our heauenly father, and proſtrated at his feete, and vnder his feete, wee muſt intreate him with our teares to bee appeaſed towards vs for his mercies ſake, and to be pleaſed with vs for his Sonnes ſake, in whom he is well pleaſed. We muſt, I ſay, implore him by his fatherly pitie to lay his rods aſide, each one with godly <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 6.1.</note> ſaying and praying, Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chaſtiſe me in thy wrath. But if our moſt wiſe and prouident fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finde it not expedient for vs to ſpare vs, and to let vs paſſe vnpuniſhed; then muſt we throw our ſelues downe at his feete, and offer willingly both our bodies and our goods vnto his blowes. Let vs ſuffer his puniſhment with all patience, his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with all ſubmiſſion of minde: let vs beware to murmur againſt our good father, though his blowes ſeeme ſomewhat bitter, and his ſtripes touch vs to the quicke: let vs alwaies intertaine

this chriſtian cogitation in our hearts, that our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a moſt wiſe father, and therefore knoweth well, yea better then any other, and beſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what is moſt for our good: and that hee is a moſt good father, and one that loueth his children moſt dearely and entirely, and therefore will doe nothing vnto vs, but that which will doe vs much good.</p>
               <p>In the meane time let each one that is chaſtiſed, beſeech God to doe it in ſo mercifull a manner, that his correction may ſerue for his erection and direction all the daies of his life: That it may ſerue for his inſtruction euer thereafter, and not for his deſtruction, as it doth to the obdured and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: and therefore let him ſay and pray with the holy prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> Lord, correct me,<note place="margin">Ierem. 10.24.</note> but with iudgement (that is, with moderation and meaſure) not in thine anger, leſt thou bring me to nothing. Finally, he muſt be ſo farre from making peruerſe inference vpon the correction of God, as though it did argue that God did hate him, becauſe of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him ſo; that he muſt gather the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie concluſion therof, and euen ſay to himſelf thus; The man God loueth moſt, hee correcteth moſt; for ſo ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> the wiſe, My ſonne,<note place="margin">Prou. 3.11.12. Pſalm. 9 4.12.</note> refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neither bee grieued with his correction: for the Lord correcteth him whom he loueth, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the father doth the childe in whom he delighteth. So ſaith the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Hebrews;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.5.6.7.8.</note> Whom the Lord loueth hee chaſteneth, and he ſcourgeth euery ſonne that hee receiueth. If ye endure chaſtening, God offereth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21025:15"/>
himſelfe vnto you as vnto ſonnes; for what ſonne is it, whom the father chaſteneth not? If therefore ye be without correction, whereof all are partakers, then are yee baſtards, and not ſons. Laſtly, ſo ſaith our Sauiour himſelfe by his ſeruant S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reuel. 3.19.</note> As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as I loue, I doe rebuke and chaſten; bee zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous therefore and amend.</p>
               <p>Thus wee haue three true witneſſes, and one of them more then a witnes, telling and teſtifying, that correction &amp; chaſtiſement is a token of Gods loue. And we know, or at leaſt ought to know, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, being true, euery word muſt ſtand; ſo then, if God correct vs becauſe he loueth vs, as it is moſt certaine that hee doth, we muſt not doubt, but that it is done for our good. And therefore the holy Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was as much beloued of God as any; and therfore as much chaſtiſed of God as any, and who profited as much by correction and affliction as any, ſaith of himſelfe thus;<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.67.71.</note> It is good for me that I haue been afflicted, that I may learne thy ſtatutes. For before I was afflicted and chaſtiſed, I went aſtray; but now I keepe thy word. As if he ſhould ſay, affliction is a good rod, for it bringeth to God. Thus haue I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nature, qualitie and good effects of the feare of God, ſo much as me thought might ſuffice for the declaration of the firſt rule of this Art, which taketh his beginning from that, which is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning both of wiſdome, and of durable wealth.

               <p>And as the merchant and trafficking man muſt take paines to be skilfull in his calling, ſo muſt the husbandman and the labourer of the ground labor to vnderſtand all things belonging to his farme, his plough, his cattell, his paſture, the fruits of his land, and the flockes of his ſheepe.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 26.12.13.14.</note> To the end, that with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he may find an hundreth fold by eſtimation of his ſowing, and waxe mightie in flocks of ſheep, in heards of cattell, and in a great houſhold.

In one word, euerie man that deſireth to bee rich, muſt endeauour to vnderſtand the nature, qualitie, ſecrets, and perfection of his own vocation. Which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21025:19"/>
if hee doe, and ioyne thereunto the feare of the Lord, whereby he ſhall draw downe Gods bleſſing vpon his adoes, he cannot but proſper.</p>
               <p>But I know it will bee obiected, that it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeene, that many ignorant men, many fooliſh and vnwiſe folkes are very rich: and on the other part, that many wiſe, learned, and well qualified men are oftentimes very poore; ſo that it may ſeeme that this ſecond rule doth not hold true, &amp;c. Hereunto I anſwere thus; It is very true which the Preacher of Ieruſalem hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſt. 9.11.</note> that he ſaw vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne, that the bread is not to the wiſe, nor riches to men of vnderſtanding, neither fauour to men of knowledge; meaning, that wealth, riches, honour, and fauour of princes and great men doe not befall onely, and alwaies vnto wiſe, learned, and well qualified perſons, but alſo, and that very often, vnto ignorants, idiots and fooles: and yet notwithſtanding the wiſe Preacher doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelfe. For although aſwell the euill as the good may bee rich, yet it is in a very different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For the ignorant and vnwiſe cannot be rich in God, nor with a good conſcience, nor yet durablie rich, as the wiſe and well qualified are.<note place="margin">Prou. 8.18.</note> Riches and honour are with mee (ſaith <hi>Salomons</hi> Wiſedome) euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe. So that durable riches and righteouſneſſe, that is, goods with a good conſcience,<note place="margin">Prou. 13.9.11. &amp; 14.11.18.</note> are only proper vnto ſuch as are wiſe. For the riches of vanitie (ſaith he) that is of folly, ſhal diminiſh; the candle of the wicked ſhall be put out, his houſe ſhall bee deſtroyed, and the fooliſh ſhall inherit follie. In one word, his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21025:20"/>
though in themſelues they bee goods, yet are they not goods to him, becauſe they turne not to his good,<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſt. 13.25</note> but rather to his euill. For (as <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Syrach</hi> ſaith) riches are good, or goods vnto him that hath no ſinne in his conſcience: that is, vnto the man that hath not gotten, increaſed, kept and vſed, or rather abuſed them with an euil conſcience. And as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> that vnto the pure are all things pure, but vnto them that are defiled and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing, is nothing pure, but euen their minds and conſciences are impure: So likewiſe may it be wel ſaid, that vnto the godly and good, are al things good, but vnto them that are godleſſe and euill, is nothing good, but euen their verie goods to them are not goods, but euils. For as to the godly all things turne to the beſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> ſo to the godleſſe, al things, yea, euen ſuch things as in themſelues bee good, turne to the worſt. And this is the ſaying of <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Syrach;</hi> The principall things for the whole vſe of mans life, is water, fire and yron, ſalt and meale, wheate, honey and milke, the blood of the grape,<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſt. 39.26.27.</note> oyle and clothing. All theſe things are for good to the godly, but to the ſinners they are turned into euill. So then this ſtandeth ſure, that although fooliſh, vnwiſe and ignorant men may be rich, yet can they not bee rich in God. For I haue now ſhewed,<note place="margin">Luke 12.15.16.17.18.19.20.21</note> his goods to him are not goods, and his riches are not durable riches. So ſaith Ieſus, the Sonne of God, in the Goſpell, of that rich foole, whoſe ground brought foorth fruits plenteouſly, ſo that he was conſtrained to build bigger barnes, to gather in his graines and his goods; and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21025:20"/>
ſaid to his ſoule; Soule, ſoule, thou haſt much goods laid vp for many yeeres, eate, drinke, liue at eaſe, and take thy paſtime: O foole (ſaith our Sauiour) this night will they fetch away thy ſoule from thee; then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt prouided? And thus ſhall it fare with the man that gathereth riches to himſelfe, and is not rich in God: Euen with the man who hath gotten or increaſed goods with an euill conſcience, who hath goods and gold, but wanteth goodneſſe and godlineſſe; who is wiſe in the world, but not wiſe in God. Euen hee whoſe gold is his God, whoſe houſe is his heauen, whoſe bed is his <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, whoſe boord is to him the banket of the Lambe, whoſe praying is his playing, whoſe almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds are all miſdeeds, whoſe faſting is his feaſting; and in one word, whoſe temporall fulneſſe is his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall felicitie.</p>
               <p>As for the other part of the obiection touching the pouertie and need of many men that both feare God, and are wiſe and endued with great vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and for the more full ſatisfaction thereof; it is to bee conſidered, that about pouertie and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, there doe occurre three diuers indeauours of men diuerſlie diſpoſed. Some are voluntarie yoke-embracers, others are voluntarie yoke-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and other ſome are voluntarie yoke-breakers; and all the three orders are praiſable, though in a different degree. The firſt two are properly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the art of pouertie; for there is a kind of pouertie that doth require both great skil and great courage to embrace it, or to beare it, as it ſhould,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21025:21"/>
and ought to bee embraced or borne. So that the rules and precepts of this art do not concerne them who are either willing embracers, or patient bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of pouerties yoke, but onely the third kind, who are yoke-breakers, that is, ſuch as labour and ſtudie to breake in peeces pouerties yoke, and to wind themſelues out of want by winning of wealth by their vertuous endeauours. For this art teacheth a man, not how to make himſelfe poore for Chriſts ſake (which is an attempt and ſtudie of an higher pitch) but how to make himſelfe rich in God and with a good conſcience, that hee may haue whereupon to impart vnto the poore for Chriſts ſake.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeak a little more of the two firſt kinds of men; the voluntarie yoke-embracers, I call ſuch as being rich, doe willingly abandon their riches to embrace pouerties yoke; either by forſaking all that they haue for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpell, as in the times and places of perſecution; or by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing away all that they haue, or the moſt part vnto the poore for Chriſts ſake, and that in the time of peace and immunitie from perſecution:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.20.22 &amp; 19.27.28.29. Luke 12.33. Act. 2.44.45. &amp; 4.34.35.</note> Such rare men eſteeming it their greateſt glorie to reſemble our Sauiour by making themſelues poore, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their pouertie may be made rich. Euen as our bleſſed Ieſus, who was rich, as heire of heauen and earth, for our ſakes became poore, &amp; ſo poore, that hee had not a houſe, yea hardly a hole to hide his head in,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.20. Luke 9.58. 2. Cor. 8.9.</note> euen poorer then the birds of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſwallow or the ſparrow, &amp; poorer then the foxes of the field; and all this, and more then
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21025:21"/>
this, for our ſakes, that we who were poore, through his pouertie might bee made rich. And of ſuch yoke-embracers and voluntarie poore men the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church had not a few; but our age (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in deuotion is nigh dead, and charity growne cold, and perfection almoſt euery where turned into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, yea, into defection) hath but too few. Now as for theſe men, who ſeeth not but they muſt needs be poore, though they feare God neuer ſo much, and bee neuer ſo well accompliſhed for wiſedome, knowledge and good parts, ſeeing they are ſuch, as will needs bee poore, and will not bee rich?</p>
               <p>The other kind of voluntarie poore men, I call yoke-bearers, who bee they neuer ſo godly and wiſe, yet they may be and are ordinarily poore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they take not care to bee rich, their chiefe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die being to beare the yoke of pouertie patiently, with an inuincible courage &amp; fortitude of mind, &amp; to learne to bee content with a little for the loue they beare vnto tranquillitie of mind (as manie Philoſophers and morall men haue done,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.26.</note> and yet doe,) or elſe for the reſpect they haue to the eternal reward, as many Eccleſiaſticall and Churchmen haue done, and yet doe. And of this diſpoſition are all thoſe, that notwithſtanding their abilitie, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a more gainefull calling, as great as that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and perhaps greater, yet had rather decline and ſhunne the ſame, in regard of the manifold toiles, turmoiles, and dangerous ſnares it is ſubiect vnto, and betake themſelues vnto a leſſe gainefull calling; ſo that it be not accompanied with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21025:22"/>
headſtrong tentations and entanglements, as the other is enuironed with. As for example, a man that had rather follow the profeſſion of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie in the Academie for ſmall gaines, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the practiſe of phyſicke in the citie or countrie with much gaines. Or a man that had rather play the phyſition and ſauer of the ſicke in the bed for little, then the pleader of the ignorants cauſe at the barre for much. For this ſecond order of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth for the moſt part of theſe two ſorts; of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall and liberall profeſſours, and of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical miniſters, which for the moſt part are poore, though in the meane time they be both godly and wiſe, and be appointed of God to teach and preach vnto men godlineſſe and wiſdome.</p>

As alſo for that the richer ſort of lay-men be generally ſo loath to conſecrate any one of their children to the ſeruice of God, ſo that they do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a gaineful calling, be it neuer ſo baſe, vnto that which is the Queen of callings. If we wil reade the hiſtories of Kingdomes and Countries, yea euen but thoſe of our owne, we ſhal find how in former times, the ſons of Monarches, Kings and Princes haue been Miniſters, Preachers and prieſts in Gods houſe: and yet now adaies, we ſee that a Lawyers, a Merchants, yea, a tradeſmans ſonne will skorne to be a Miniſter, if he haue any meanes. Alas miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men that wee are, wee are ſo deafe wee cannot heare what the Euangelicall Prophet (who was both a Preacher, and of princely blood, euen bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſonne of <hi>Vzziah</hi> King of Iudah) proclaimeth touching the dignitie of the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell;<note place="margin">Iſai. 52.7.</note> How beautifull (ſaith he, and after him the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi>)<note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> vpon the mountaines are the

For this thing, godly <hi>Daniel</hi> (who was firſt a priſoner,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note> and afterward both a Prophet in the Church, and a Prince in the Common-wealth vnder the King) or rather the holy Angell by his mouth telleth vs. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, we are ſo ignorant and lumpiſh, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſider,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.28.</note> how that poore fiſhermen for being Chriſts Miniſters, ſhall in that great day ſit vpon twelue thrones, and iudge the twelue Tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, as the great Iudge of the world hath ſaid. And therefore to ſhut vp this preſent diſcourſe, I my ſelf being a lay-man, wiſh all lay-men to giue care vnto the exhortation of the holy Apoſtle; We beſeech you brethren,<note place="margin">1.

Trulie in my conceit, their pouertie is to be pitied, but yet their idleneſſe me thinketh cannot
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21025:28"/>
be excuſed. Neither can I ſee, how a mans Gentili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie can be diſparaged any whit by the meanes of a vertuous art of an honeſt craft or occupation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I ſee any ſuch antipathie, or oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Gentilitie, and mechanicall induſtrie that they cannot conſiſt together. No, no, they can well enough agree together, though poore Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen be loath and are aſhamed, that in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they ſhould ioyne together. But this ſhame of theirs is not a good ſhame, but ſuch a ſhame as they ought rather to bee aſhamed of. Gentilitie tooke the firſt originall from vertue, and there is no Gentilitie or Nobilitie in blood, but in regard of the ſeeds of vertue, which are ſuppoſed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie the blood of ſuch as are called Gentlemen borne. The which thing being true, as it is moſt true, it followeth that Gentilitie cannot be either extinguiſhed, or impaired by a mechanicall trade, which is likewiſe grounded and founded vpon vertue, and is practiſed for the cheriſhing of vertue, and the quelling of vice. So that Gentilitie, and mechanicall induſtry are ſiſters, euen the daughters of one dame; for vertue is the mother and miſtris of both. Men may well ſet them together by the eares; but (as I ſaid before) they of themſelues could well enough agree.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 2.8.</note> The Lord himſelf would not be idle: for beſides the creation of the world, he planted a Garden Eaſtward in Eden, and ſo in a manner played the Gardiner.

had not taken him from the ſheepe-coate to make him a King, and a keeper of his people) would haue plaied the husbandman ſtill? was not young <hi>Dauid</hi> a Gentleman, euen then when hee kept the ſheepe? If any one doubt of it, I will ſhew them that he had euen then moe gentlemanlike qualities, then any of our Gentlemen now a daies haue. King <hi>Sauls</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants reported to their maſter, that <hi>Iſhai</hi> the Bethlemite had a ſonne, who was a cunning player vpon the harpe, a man of warre, ſtrong and valiant, and wiſe in matters, and a comelie perſon, and ſuch a one as feared the Lord, which is the crowne of al Gentilitie and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Wherefore King <hi>Saul</hi> ſent meſſengers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iſhai,</hi> and ſaid, ſend mee <hi>Dauid</hi> thy ſonne, which is with the ſheepe. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> was fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from the ſheepe-coate to the Kings court, and brought from feeding of ſheepe, to bee the Kings Fauorite, his Muſition and Phyſition both at once. For when the euill ſpirit came vpon the King, <hi>Dauid</hi> tooke an harpe, and plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his hand, and <hi>Saul</hi> was refreſhed and was eaſed, for the euil ſpirit departed from him. Alſo he was the Kings armour-bearer; for hee was ſo ſtrong, that when as hee yet kept his fathers ſheepe, he ſlue both a lion and a beare that came among the flocke; and afterwards in the field hee ſlew the mightie Giant <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.</hi> Finallie, hee behaued himſelfe ſo valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie againſt the Philiſtims, who were Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21025:30"/>
that by his vertue and valour, hee deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the mariage of the Kings daughter, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer that hee was (as he ſaith of himſelfe to <hi>Saules</hi> ſeruants, who in the Kings name made offer to him to bee his ſonne in law) a poore man,<note place="margin">Matth. 1.20. &amp; 13.55.

when he ſhall be asked at the laſt day, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the calling he ſhould haue followed here in this life? ſhall he haue no other thing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, but that hee was of no craft or occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe he was a Gentleman borne? what an vnſauorie anſwere will it bee before God, who not onely hath taught men mechanicall trades, but alſo diſdained not to worke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by the word of his mouth, in creating the world, in planting the garden of Paradiſe, and in making of skinne-cloathes for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue?</hi> What an vnſauourie anſwere ſhall it be, I ſay, before our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mark. 3.6. Luke 2.51. Matth. 4.18.21</note> the Sonne of God, who diſdained not to worke in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters trade in his ſuppoſed fathers houſe <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> who was of the ſame craft?<note place="margin">Iohn 21.3.</note> and before his bleſſed Apoſtles, which were fiſhermen, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a Tent-maker? Then I feare me,<note place="margin">Act. 18 1.2.3.</note> ſhall the idle Gentleman ſay; Would God I had been a Tailer, when I was a ſtealer; a Rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, when as I was a Robber; a Pedler, when as I was a Pirat; a Dier, when as I was a Dicer; a Carter, when as I was a Carder; and a Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, when as I was a ſwaggerer. Would God I had been of any lawfull calling, when as I was an idle man liuing without all calling. And trulie if a man muſt render an account of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie idle word hee ſpeaketh in this life,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.36.</note> at the day of iudgement (as our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ſaid) how much more muſt he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and giue account of his idle liuing in this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21025:31"/>
life at that day? Idleneſſe and exceſſe (as the Prophet teacheth vs) were two of the ſinnes of Sodom;<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.49.</note> and therefore if wee would ſhun and eſchew the fire and brimſtone of Sodom, let vs ſhunne and eſchew their ſinnes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that (as the Wiſe man telleth vs) the drunkard and the glutton ſhall bee poore,<note place="margin">Prou. 23.21.</note> and the idle ſleeper ſhall bee clothed with ragges; And the labouring man that is giuen to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 19.1. &amp; 33 26.</note> ſhall not bee rich. Thus we ſee then, that diligence and temperance are of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both to get and augment riches. And trulie as the loue of intemperance and exceſſe doth hold the poore man from being rich, ſo doth the practiſe of exceſſe in table or appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell make the rich man poore, as wee ſhall ſhew in the declaration of the ninth Rule of this Art.</p>
               <p>And therefore to conclude this preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning diligence in a lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I wiſh the ſtudent in this Art to obſerue this one thing, that except hee begge dailie Gods bleſſing to his buſineſſe, his diligence and induſtrie will but little auaile.

hee ſhall bee ſpoiled of them,<note place="margin">Prou. 28.8.

profeſſed &amp; practiſed, prouoketh God more then a greater ſinne doth, if it be by the Magiſtrate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and puniſhed, It is not in the Princes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to keep ſinne out of his Citty or Kingdome, neither is he liable to iudgement &amp; puniſhment for that, which commeth not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his poſſibility; But it lyeth in his power to keepe out of his kingdome a ſchoole-houſe for ſinne, and a worke-houſe for wickedneſſe; and therefore if hee doe otherwiſe for any reſpect whatſoeuer, hee in ſo doing maketh himſelfe and his kingdome obnoxious vnto Gods indignation. In one word it is an intolerable ſhame, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who are called to ſtudy and learne in Chriſts ſchoole, mortification and ſanctification of the fleſh, ſhould haue a ſchoole of ſinne opened vp to them, wherein they can learne no other thing but to offend God, to ſlay their owne ſoules, to conſume their bodies, and to waſt their ſubſtance, and in one word, to make ſhipwracke at once of godlineſſe, goodneſſe and their goods. Hereunto alſo it belongeth that no amorous or voluptuous books, ballads, or ſongs, nor no laſciuious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane plaies, or repreſentations ought or are to ſuffered in a Chriſtian Commonwealth: For as the whore-houſe is the diuels ſchoole-houſe, and whoremongers are the keepers and vſhers of the ſchoole vnder the great maiſter thereof, the ſpirit of vncleannes; ſo amorous and laſciuious bookes, ballads, and ſongs, are the bookes that this vncleane ſchoolemaiſter maketh his ſcholers buy, to teach them how to defile their bodies, and to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21025:45"/>
ſlay their ſoules, that in the end they may be made fit fewel for hell-fire: And laſciuious ſtage-playes and repreſentations are the ſame vncleane ſchool-maiſters ſports, paſtimes, and plaies, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth vnto his ſchollers, for to quicken and encourage them, in the ſtudy and exerciſe of ſinne; Not that I meane to condemne all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of ſtage-playings, minſtrelzies, or muſicke, for I doubt not, but in themſelues they are all lawfull, and may bee ſo vſed, that men may bee much furthered thereby in the way of vertue; But onely that in a Chriſtian Commonwealth great care ought to be had, leaſt that any of them be abuſed to the ſtirring vp, inticing or alluring of men vnto ſinne, prophanity, vanity, and vice. Truely in my conceite, the ſtories and accidents of the time paſt may bee repreſented in ſuch maner vpon the ſtage, that both men and woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may bee more and more ſtirred vp to loue and follow vertue, and to hate and flie vice, to feare to offend God, and to tremble at his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhewed from time to time vpon men and woemen for their ſinnes; and ſtage-plaies being thus vſed, are in mine opinion both lawfull, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, pleaſant, and profitable. But if either the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in part, or in whole, be laſciuious and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or yet the wordes wherewith it is expreſſed, or the geſtures whereby it is acted, bee either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, irreligious, filthy, and prophane, or hurtfull to honeſt eares, or offenſiue to modeſt eyes; then in that caſe, the Chriſtian Magiſtrate ought to puniſh all ſuch abuſes of ſtage-plaies: for ſtage-playing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21025:46"/>
being thus abuſed, is no better then a contemplatiue brothel-houſe. For there men are taught by the laſciuious and wanton words and geſtures which they vſe in playing, how to play the vncleane perſons, and in the brothel-houſe they put in practiſe the ſinne, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which they learned at the ſtage, by the eare and by the eye. And therefore I wiſh that all ſtage-players ſhould ſo carry themſelues, that they miniſter not any occaſion of ſinne, and vice vnto their auditors and ſpectators, but rather help them and further them what they can, to vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liuing, whereas otherwiſe by abuſing their exerciſe to ſinne, both ſinning themſelues and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing others to ſinne, they ſhall heape vp vnto themſelues wrath againſt the day of wrath and endleſſe confuſion, for making an exerciſe and trade of ſinne, to heape vp vnto themſelues wealth and money here on earth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſay the Chriſtian ought to beware, leaſt he gather or increaſe his wealth, by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaging and impoueriſhing of his neighbour through playing and game. If no man wiſheth or would willingly that another ſhould winne his money or goods, by play, then no man ought to deſire to winne another mans money by that way, for it is expreſly againſt the law of God; which beareth that the thing a man would not to be done vnto himſelfe, he ought not do it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Not that I meane to condemne all playing at cards, or any ſuch other games as vnlawfull, for there is nothing more reaſonable, then that a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21025:46"/>
man may well take a little of his time from his more ſerious affaires, for refreſhing of himſelfe with any honeſt paſſetime, to the end he may be the better enabled to follow the actions of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary calling, and yet muſt it be but a little time that is this way ſpent: for time is pretious, and therefore ought to bee employed and ſpent in pretious employments, neither muſt hee make a vocation of a recreation, or of an houres paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, an ordinary practiſe, for God hath not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led men to play away time, but to ſpend time in good and godly employments, and to redeeme time by doubling our diligence, when as we haue idily miſpent any part thereof. True it is that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers good men haue thought playing at cards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnlawfull, in regard that they do beare in their conceite, the nature and quality of a Lot, which being vſed to diuine purpoſes, ought not to be abuſed to any humane or prophane action or affaire. But by their leaue, their reaſon is not ſo ſound as they do ſuppoſe. For if cardes be lots, then it were lawfull for men to vſe cardes in the conſulting of God for the determination of ſome certaine doubtes, as wee read both in the old and the new Teſtament, that lots haue beene vſed, and if this be abſurd, then it followeth that they are not lottes as they do imagine. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that to be true which they ſay, euen that cardes are Lottes, I ſay that it doth not follow, but that they may be vſed in humane affaires:<note place="margin">Prou. 18, 18.</note> for it is well knowne, that Lottes haue bene, and yet are lawfully vſed, in ciuill bargaines and buſineſſes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21025:47"/>
belonging to partition and diuiſion of lands, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe and wares; and why may they not bee likewiſe vſed in other humane exerciſes of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and plaies? Of their owne nature, lottes are indifferent, and are neither in themſelues good or euill, diuine or humane but become ſuch by the abuſe or right vſe thereof; Euen as Muſicke which is vſed both at home, for humane delight and recreation, and in Gods houſe, in the diuine and ſolemne celebration of ſeruice, and as it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous, to thinke or maintaine, that Muſicke, whether in voyces or inſtruments, may not be vſed at home for humane delight, becauſe it is vſed in the houſe of God, to the ſetting forth of Gods praiſes; ſo were it a thing no leſſe abſurd and ridiculous, to argue, that Lottes may not bee vſed in humane delights and recreations, becauſe that they haue bene ſometlme vſed in the conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God, for the determination of certaine doubts. Hence it followeth, that though cardes were a kind of Lottes, yet they may bee lawfully vſed in exerciſes, of play and paſſetime. But in the meane time the Chriſtian muſt take diligent heede, leaſt hee abuſe a lawfull recreation to his owne damnation hereafter, and to the indamage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelfe or of his neighbour here, and therefore he muſt not make of an houres recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a dayly or a nightly vocation (as I ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) nor yet turne a matter of delight into a matter of debate, by vnchriſtian and vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble altercations, quarrellings, and contentions; That we turne not the time of ceaſing from our
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21025:47"/>
ordinary actions, and of ſolacing our ſelues, into a time of ſinning, by ſwearing, banning, curſing, and blaſpheming the bleſſed name of God, and of his Sonne Ieſus. A man alſo muſt beware, leaſt hee change the nature of the thing it ſelfe, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it of an exceriſe of pleaſure and company, an exerciſe of profite and commodity. For a man ought to play, onely to refreſh himſelfe, not to enrich himſelfe by anothers loſſe, not yet to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poueriſh himſelfe by anothers winning; The one is vnthriftineſſe, and doth not beſeeme a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or prouident man; the other is couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and doth not become a Chriſtian. So that if men will needs play for money, it were very well done, to play for no more, then they would willingly beſtow vpon the poore, and therefore Chriſtians ſhall ſhew themſelues Chriſtians, in the very playing at cards, if they ſhall agree vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conuerting the wager being wonne, into ſome charitable vſe, for the ſupport of the indigent brethren; If they do otherwiſe, they play not as becommeth Chriſtians, but do bewray their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, and vncharitable diſpoſition, flowing from a baſe minde, which is ſo farre bewitched with the loue of money, that it maketh them to forget that they are Chriſten men. And chiefly this ought to be the practiſe of all Carders, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and gameſters, at Chriſtmaſſe, and ſuch other Feſtiaull times, euen to play for the poore, and to giue the gaine of our gaiming to God, To the end that the poore being ſupported by this meanes, may bee the more encouraged to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21025:48"/>
ioyfully the ſolemne time of our Sauiours birth. For what thing is there more vnbeſeeming Chriſtianity, then for men to ſpend the dayes of this feſtiuall time, in playing to gather money for themſelues, and to practiſe either more coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, or elſe more vnthriftineſse, at this time more then at any other? What thing is there I ſay or can there be more vnbecomming a Chriſtian, then not to ſpend this time in the exerciſe of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards God, and of charity towards our neighbour for his ſake? Shall one Chriſtian be ſo vnchriſtianly affected as to turne his playing with his brother into a preying vpon his brother, ſo that his couetouſneſse cannot bee quenched till he haue emptied his purſe? Or ſhall the Chriſtian play, and not ſhew himſelfe a Chriſtian in his playing, by imparting the pence hee hath wonne vnto the poore? and therefore to ſhut vp this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcourſe, as the Apoſtle exhorteth vs, that whether we eate or drinke, we doe all to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, ſo ſay I of this matter; whether wee play for money, or lay money for a wager, let vs alwaies remember to play and lay like Chriſtian and charitable men: and in all our actions let our piety towards God, and our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards our neighbours appeare.</p>

good office ſoeuer we performe at any time vnto Gods Miniſters, but chiefly to his chiefe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that hee doth repute as done vnto himſelfe.

Ioh. 10.34.35.</note> as we muſt honor God with our riches, and the oblations of our handes, ſo muſt wee likewiſe them whom God hath called Gods: to wit, godly Princes, whom when as wee honour with our riches, in giuing them cheerefully a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their honourable prouiſion, then wee honour God himſelfe with our riches, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> exhorteth all men to doe that would haue God to bleſſe them with aboundance. And truly if wee would bee loath to let God want (if hee were ſubiect to want in his owne perſon, as man is, then ought wee likewiſe bee loath to let the Prince want, who repreſenteth God, and therefore is called God (to teach vs) that what wee beſtow vpon him we offer vnto God)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21025:58"/>
and in whoſe perſon God oftentimes carrieth himſelfe as one that wanteth, and ſtandeth in neede of our helpe. And if wee would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cheerefully, and without murmuring beſtowe vpon our moſt bountifull father, our goods, in whole or in halfe, then truely wee ought not to murmure or grudge to beſtowe vpon Princes, (whom God hath called by the name of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the moſt high) a conuenient portion of the ſame, at leaſt, for their fathers ſake.<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.6.</note> So that a Chriſtian ſubiect, when hee ſeeth a king, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Chriſtian king, and ſuch a one as beſides his power is adorned with the diuine qualities of wiſedome, bountie, iuſtice, and mercie, hee ought to thinke with himſelfe, that he ſeeth God in mans likeneſſe. And when ſuch a one asketh a Subſidie, or any ſuch releefe at his ſubiects hands, hee ought to ſhewe himſelfe as willing and ready thereunto, as hee ſhould if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a mans likeneſſe were come downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men to craue a ſacrifice or oblation at their hands.</p>
               <p>And though it bee true, that Almightie God doth not ſtand in need of any thing wee haue, (for hee is al-ſufficient in himſelfe) yet wee muſt thinke that it is his pleaſure to carrie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as one that doth need oftentimes in the perſons of the Prince, the Prieſts, and the Poore. And this hee doth, to trie whether wee loue Almightie God and our neighbour better then our goods, or no, and to knowe by the effect, if wee haue as yet attained to this
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21025:59"/>
perfection, as to giue vnto God all that we haue, if he ſhould require it at our hands. For the man that will grudge to giue a part vnto Gods image and chiefe miniſter for his ſake, will neuer be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forſake all for Gods ſake: no, hee would neuer be willing to beſtowe his whole goods vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God himſelfe, that will refuſe or repine to giue a part vnto his chiefe miniſter. And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, the man that doth cheerefully beſtowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the prince, in regard that he is Gods image and deputie, doth euidently ſhew that he loueth God better then his goods, and goodneſſe better then his goods, and that he would make no difficultie to beſtowe moſt willingly all that hee hath vpon God; yea to forſake his whole goods for Gods ſake. Wherefore if we reſolue to giue cheerefully vnto Gods Vicar for his ſake, a proportionable portion of our goods, he will both account it as giuen vnto himſelfe, and will reward the giuer for his gift,<note place="margin">2.

Kings bee alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods, for that they muſt excell all other men, as in power, ſo likewiſe in beneficence: ſo that the Prince, as hee ſhall haue cauſe and occaſion, may lawfully aske, craue, and receiue a part of his richer ſubiects goods, and giue of the ſame to ſuch as are poorer. And this he may doe, yea and ought to doe, to the end his beneficence &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

(wherein he muſt reſemble God moſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) may bee ſhewed and continued,<note place="margin">Pſal. 112.9. 2.

In one word, to the end that both his poorer ſubiects may be releeued, and his faithfull ſeruants may be rewarded.</p>
               <p>Princes are likewiſe called Gods, to ſhewe vs that they haue a right, I ſay not vnto all, but vnto a certaine part of each of their ſubiects goods. For as I would be loath to flatter the prince and wrong the people, by affirming or maintaining the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his right and intereſt to the bodies and whole goods of his ſubiects (for the moſt abſolute Prince that is, muſt not thinke himſelfe ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: and as it were a ridiculous thing to ſubiect the prince to his ſubiects lawes, ſo were it an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crime, to exempt him from Gods lawes) as I would be loath, I ſay, to flatter the prince, and wrong the people, by affirming his right to their whole goods, ſo would I be loath to flatter the people, and wrong the Prince, by denying his right to a proportionable part of their goods. And therefore as God doth require at his peoples hands, for the maintenance of his miniſters, firſt fruits, becauſe he is the firſt, and tythes becauſe he is the laſt (as an auncient writer yeeldeth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) and that in name of an annuall and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all rent, and in token of a double acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we owe him: the one, that he is <hi>alpha</hi> and <hi>omega,</hi> the beginning and the ending, the firſt and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21025:60"/>
the laſt: the other, that all that we haue, we haue it and hold it of him. So Princes, who are called Gods, of God himſelfe, and are his immediate ſubiects, and his ſubiects onely, and are liable, if they offend, to the puniſhment of his hand one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they may iuſtly claime and require at their ſubiects hands a competent portion of their goods, for the maintenance of themſelues, their families, and ſeruants, as the holy Prophet <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> deſcribing the qualitie and priuiledge of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Prince, doth aboundantly teſtifie. For the holy Prophet diſſwading the Iſraelites from the ſeeking of a King as yet,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 8.14.15.16.17.</note> and before the conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time (for as yet the time was not come that God ſhould ſet his ſeruant <hi>Dauid</hi> aboue them, who was to be the firſt elected King of Iſrael with Gods abſolute approbation, and the type &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of the king of kings, according to the fleſh) telleth them before hand what power he ſhould haue ouer them and their goods. And namely, that he would not only take their fields and their vineyards, and giue them to his ſeruants, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in caſe they did heinouſly offend againſt his lawes, (for as God is the Law-giuer of Kings, ſo are Kings the Law-giuers of their people) but alſo yearly aske and take the tenth of their cornes, of their vineyards, of their fruits, and of their flockes, for the maintenance of himſelfe, and of his ſeruants. And yet in all this, the holy man painteth out no vſurping or vntitular tyrant,<note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> but euen an orderly elected king, that is, ſuch a king as they themſelues with a common conſent
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21025:60"/>

To which purpoſe the wordes of the Prophet are moſt perſpicuous and cleare, read them who will.</p>
               <p>But hereof wee ſhall entreat more fully in our <hi>Alboni,</hi> or Patterne of a perfit Subiect; wherein we ſhall God-willing diſcourſe ſubſtantially and ſoundly of the ſeuerall duties of ſubiects, in the behalfe of Princes. And out of doubt, their firſt king <hi>Saul</hi> raigned in this manner ouer them, and yet wee find him not blamed for any tyrannicall oppreſſion, extortion, or exaction practiſed vpon his people: whereof, if hee had beene guiltie, it ſhould haue beene recorded, no doubt, amongſt his other grieuous treſpaſſes. Likewiſe king <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> who was their firſt king, by Gods abſolute ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation (and therefore the ſpirit of God hath begun with <hi>Dauid</hi> the firſt Booke of the Kings) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a man after Gods own heart,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>And as for <hi>Salomon,</hi> king <hi>Dauids</hi> ſonne and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, it is more then manifeſt, that he did put in practiſe this foreſaid kingly power,<note place="margin">1.

Giue thy iudgements to the king,<note place="margin">Pſal. 72.1, 2, 3.4.12.13, 14.</note> O God, and thy righteouſneſſe to the kings ſonne: Then ſhall he iudge thy people in righteouſneſſe, and thy poore with equity: the mountaines and the hilles ſhall bring peace to the people by iuſtice.

Shall we thinke I ſay, that the holy Prophets prayer and prediction touching the excellencie of his ſonnes, godly, iuſt, and peaceable gouernment, was either falſe,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21025:61"/>
or of none effect? God forbid: farre bee it from vs to thinke that God would haue choſen an oppreſſor of his people to bee a type of the king of righteouſneſſe, to bee his ſonne,<note place="margin">1 Chron, 22.9, 10.11. &amp; 28.5.6, 10.</note> and to build the houſe of his ſanctuarie.

               <p>Wherefore wee muſt not thinke that hee was guiltie of tyrannie, oppreſſion, or exaction in the behalfe of his people: but rather that his leuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tenths of his ſubiects ſubſtance, was an effect of his diuine wiſedome, and the lawfull meanes whereby hee gathered together ſo much wealth, and ſo great riches as he did,<note place="margin">1 King 9.20.21.</note> together with the tribute hee did receiue at the hands of many other nations.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted, that the people of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and Iſrael by their cheerefull readineſſe and willingneſſe in yeelding vnto <hi>Salomon</hi> their king the Tenthes of their fruites and of their flockes, for the monthly prouiſion of his houſhold, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured at Gods hands the bleſſing of great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, ſecuritie, and peace, which hee powred vpon Iſrael and Iudah in <hi>Salomons</hi> daies.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 22.9. 1 King. 4.20.25.</note> They multiplied as the ſand of the ſea in number, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, drinking, and making merrie.

If we haue ſowen vnto you ſpiritual things, it is a great thing if we reape your carnall things: doe ye not knowe that they which miniſter about the holy things, eate of the things of the temple? and they which waite at the altar are partakers with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar?

O how vgly then is the ſinne of ſacriledge, that beareth neuertheleſſe ſuch a ſway in this Iſle!

It is a ſinne of that high nature, that becauſe of it God hath ſaid vnto vs,<note place="margin">Malach. 3.9, 10, 11.</note> as once he ſaid vnto the people of Iſrael vpon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ye are curſed with a curſe, for ye haue ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, euen this whole nation: and that he hath ſometimes ſent ſcarcenes of bread,<note place="margin">Amos 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> and cleanneſſe of teeth in our cities, and townes, ſometimes hath with-holden the raine from vs, when there were yet three months to the harueſt, and ſhut the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of heauen vpon vs,<note place="margin">Iſa. 16, 9, 10.</note> &amp; ſtaied the raine til the fruits of the earth were deſtroyed with drought, ſomtimes hath ſmitten our fruits with blaſting &amp; mildew, &amp; ſent the palmer-worm to deuoure the fruits of our trees,<note place="margin">Hagg. 1.10, &amp; 2.18.</note> yea made our ſinging &amp; ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for ioy in harueſt to ceaſe, &amp; made vs drunke with our tears, for that the heauen aboue vs was

               <p>In one word, it is this horrible ſin of ſacriledge that hath ouerthrowne the ſtrength and glory of diuers mighty and wealthy houſes; God in his moſt iuſt iudgement shutting ſuch from their inheritance, as were ſo audacious and bold as to robbe him of his.<note place="margin">Iob. 15.25.26, 27.</note> The ſacrilegious God-ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is the man which (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh) hath ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out his hand againſt God, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtrong againſt the Almightie.

The heauen ſhall declare his wickedneſſe (for he was ſo impious as to ſpoyle the God of heauen) and the earth ſhall riſe vp againſt him (for he was ſo vngracious as to robbe Gods Miniſters and Vicegerents on earth) the increaſe of his houſe shall goe away, it shall flow away in the day of his wrath.

their brethren,<note place="margin">Ioel. 1.</note> whereof now many were ſlaine and carried away captiue. And the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> ſoundeth into their eares this exhortation and commination, Awake ye drunkards, and weepe, howle all ye drinkers of wine, becauſe of the new wine, for it ſhall be pulled from your mouth.

               <p>If this be true, which the Truth hath both ſaid, and ſaieth he ſhall ſay, then truely many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of this laſt age, in Gods account, are accurſed, and many of the men of theſe laſt daies, muſt needs go at the laſt day into euerlaſting fire. Euen as many as doe now refuſe to feed and refreſh, to cloth and to lodge, to viſit &amp; to comfort Chriſt Ieſus, liuing, or rather dying daily amongſt vs, in the perſons of poore, needie, ſicke, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe men. Charitie is growne ſo cold in theſe laſt daies, that Chriſt may well wander through our ſtreets, wee will not bring him in, hee may ſtand crying at our doors, and ſtarue of hunger &amp; cold, for fault of food and clothes, we will neither fill his bellie, nor couer his backe; hee may lie ſicke and ſore in the high way, and in the corners of our townes, we will not build him an hoſpitall, or if we doe, it is ſo little it can hardly lodge him, or hold him, neither will wee take the paines to goe ſee him there, to cauſe miniſter him medicine, to bind vp his wounds, to cure his ſores, and to comfort him in his anguiſh. He may for vs lie in priſon with fetters on his feet, and yet the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe rich man that hath put him in priſon, will not proue the deliuerer, and ſet him free; nor yet will one or moe rich men prooue the redeemer, and pay his debts, that he may be ſet at libertie. Yea, hee may lie dead at our doores, or in the high ſtreets, and ſcarcely will we burie him; or if we bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie him, we will be aſhamed to accompany him to the buriall place, hee is in his members ſo abiect
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21025:83"/>
and contemptible in our eies. Euery man findeth out ſome one excuſe or other, to cloake and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this his coldneſſe of charitie. The man that hath much, and may giue much almes, ſaith, hee hath ſo much adoe with it for other vſes, that hee cannot ſpare any part thereof to releeue the poore. Chriſt in heauen (I wot well ſaith hee) hath enough, and needeth none of my goods, and if he were on earth, &amp; ſtood in need, I would not ſtand to beſtowe vpon him all that I haue. And this may ſuffice. On the other hand, the man that hath little (and yet not ſo little, but that he might impart a little thereof, vnto ſuch as haue leſſe then he) ſaith, he hath little enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: So that betweene theſe two ſorts of men, haue they much, or haue they little, Chriſt can haue nothing at all: For both of them pretend that they haue too little for themſelues, too little meate for their owne bellies, and therefore Chriſt muſt be hungrie; too little drinke for their owne mouthes, and therefore Chriſt muſt bee thirſtie: too little cloathing for their owne backes, and therefore Chriſt muſt goe vncouered, except hee be couered with ragges: too little money in their purſes, and therefore Chriſt muſt be ſtill in priſon vnredeemed.</p>
               <p>Thus then all plead they haue too little, no than is found that thinketh he hath much, or too much: And yet <hi>Salomon</hi> thought,<note place="margin">Prou. 30, 8,</note> that a man might haue too much, when hee prayed vnto the Lord, not to giue him too much. And truely, if the man hath too much burthen on his backe, when
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21025:84"/>
he doth not onely vnder it bow, but alſo breake: and if the ſhip hath too much loading, when not onely ſhee drinketh the ſalt ſea, but alſo ſinketh therein: then truely that man hath too much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, when his loue of them, confidence in them, and care for them, make the backe of his ſoule cracke, or make the ſhip of his ſoule to drinke, yea to ſinke in the infernall flood of Gods furie. Then ſhall the poore ſoule ſay, Woe is mee, that I had ſo much riches, yea too much, though once I thought a man could not haue too much,<note place="margin">Amos 4.2, Prou. 30.15.</note> but ſaid alwaies, bring, bring, giue, giue: and woe is me, I gaue ſo little almes vpon ſo much as I had, for if I had not had ſo much, and done ſo little good with my ſo much goods, I ſhould not now haue taſted of ſo much torment.

Good Lord! how is it poſſible that men can looke for ſo much good and glorie at Chriſts hands, who will yet giue ſo little of their goods, or nothing at all vnto him and his for his ſake? How can they hope at his hands to be fed with the bread of life, the hidden Manna from aboue, or refreſhed with the water of life, out of the fountaine of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice of God, or cloathed with the white robe of righteouſneſſe, and couered with the garmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

ſay that ſuch men as doe behaue themſelues in the behalfe of Chriſts poore members ſo vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably, ſhould expect at Chriſts hands, for ſuch great and ineſtimable goods? With what face I ſay, can the man craue, or yet hope to receiue at Chriſts hands, the bread and drinke of eternall life, that will refuſe to miniſter vnto him, or his members for his ſake, the bread and drinke of this tranſitorie and temporall life? or how can hee expect to haue the filthie nakedneſſe of his ſoule couered with the white-red robes of Chriſts righteouſneſſe in this life, and after this life to bee clothed both ſoule and body with the robe-roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of glorie, who wil refuſe now to couer Chriſts nakedneſſe with a peece of his courſe cloth, or with his old clothes?</p>
               <p>It is recorded of the firſt Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Act. 2.44, 45, &amp; 4.34, 35.</note> that they had all things common, for they ſold their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and goods, and parted them to all men, as euery one had need; ſo that there was none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that lacked. Was it ſo? then, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, how vnlike are our Chriſtians of theſe laſt times, vnto thoſe of the firſt times! euen as vnlike vnto them in deuotion and charitie, as were the feet of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image vnto the head thereof, in nature and qualitie.<note place="margin">Dan. 2.32, 33.</note> The head of the image was of fine gold, but the feet of it were part of yron, and part of clay. And the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were euen fine as the fineſt gold of Ophir, they were tried &amp; fined euery day in the furnace of affliction: godlineſſe to them was gaine, and their glorie was not to gather and hoord vp gold,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21025:85"/>
but to giue their gold and their goods vnto the poore and needie members of Chriſt Ieſus: yea euen to forſake their gold and their goods, and to lay downe their liues for Chriſts ſake. And ſuch was the godlineſſe and goodneſſe, the pietie and charitie of thoſe golden times. But wee Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of theſe laſt times, are more like vnto the feet of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image, which were of yron and clay mingled together. Our hearts are hard as yron, we take no pitie nor compaſſion vpon the poore, they are hard as an Adamant, they are hardly mooued with any contrition or ſorrow for ſinne. As they are void of compaſsion in behalfe of the poore, ſo are they of compunction for our manifold treſpaſſes. Our hands are hard as yron, and in a manner made of yron, for they are more readie to bruize and breake our poore brethren by oppreſſion, extortion, vſurie, robberie, and all kind of hard and cruell vſage, then to helpe them any whit. Our ſoules, as they are lodged in taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of clay, ſo are they almoſt turned into a clay eie ſubſtance: for what other thing doe wee mind but claie, and corruptible things? Our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſet vpon the things that are belowe, and wee are wholly conſumed with worldly cares. So that, looke how great oddes there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene gold and yron mingled with clay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the head and the feet of that image: as great oddes is there betweene the Chriſtians of the firſt and laſt times. The firſt Chriſtians were ſellers of their ſubſtance, to the end they might giue vnto the poore: but the laſt Chriſtians
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21025:85"/>
are many of them buyers of the ſubſtance, and taskers of the goods of the poore. The firſt Chriſtians had the vſe of all things neceſſarie common: but the laſt Chriſtians haue the vſe of all things priuate. The firſt Chriſtians parted their goods among ſuch as had neede: but the laſt Chriſtians doe rather plucke and pull from ſuch as doe neede. Finally, the firſt Chriſtians ſuffered none amongſt them to lacke: but the laſt Chriſtians ſuffer many multitudes of their poore brethren, not onely to lacke, but euen to loſe their liues for want.</p>

will beſtow more vpon their horſes, their haukes, and their hounds, then they will doe vpon both; More vpon the building of a Kitchin, then of a Kyrke; more vpon a ſtable then the Lords Table.

               <p>Thus you ſee, moſt noble Cities, what hath beene the fortune and fall of a moſt noble Citie, and a citie (if euer any in the wide world) beloued of God: yee ſee the greatneſſe of her deſolation, and that her great ſinnes (for commonly in great Cities dwell great ſinnes) did occaſion the ſame; Conſidering the which, my thriſe hearty wiſh vnto God for you is that her deſolation may ſerue for your edification, and her lamentable deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be vnto you a profitable inſtruction: That auoiding and ſhunning her ſins, and all kinde of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous and heinous impietie, all ſacriledge, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolatrie, pride, adulterie, couetouſneſſe, crueltie, deceit, briberie, extortion, oppreſſion, vſurie, and vnmercifulneſſe to the poore; Finally, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of Gods holy name, by vnreuerent, and vnreſpectfull naming thereof; by ſwearing, and forſwearing; and all vnhallowing of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name, in whole, or in part, by flying from the congregation, and following our owne waies of profite and of pleaſure, and forſaking the Lords waies of piety and of charitie, yee may likewiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape her plagues, ye may be free from her worm<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wood bread, her waters of gall, her famine, her ſword, her peſtilence, her captiuity, her ſcattering, her reproach, her aſtoniſhment, her ſhame, her ſeruitude, her deſolation and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>That ſo, right noble and flouriſhing Cities, yee

may long continue noble, and long flouriſh in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and proſperity, your Citizens and inhabitants may be long rich, and euery day more and more rich, both in goods and goodneſſe, that being rich in God heere on earth, yee may be rich with God hereafter in heauen. And that this Art may end whereas it did begin, euen at God; who as he is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and the <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning, and the ending of all things: ſo me thinketh is it good reaſon, that he be the <hi>Alpha</hi> and the <hi>Omega</hi> of this Art.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.36.</note> Let euery man that deſireth to ſee good things, pray to God with good King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid:</hi> Lord incline mine heart vnto thy teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and not vnto couetouſneſſe.<note place="margin">Prou. 30.8.9.</note> And with wiſe King <hi>Salomon</hi> his ſonne: Giue me not pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nor riches too much: Feede mee with food conuenient for me, leaſt I bee full and denie thee, and ſay: Who is the Lord? or leaſt I bee poore and ſteale, and take the Name of my God in vaine. <hi>Amen.</hi>
